# PROG 01: Crunch Time

A spinner with an array source contains all 12 types of exercise was created for users to choose from (the default value is the first item in the array (Push-up)).An edit text field was designed for users to enter the amount of the specific type of exercise they did. By clicking the GO button, the button-on-click method helps to calculate the amount of calories they have burnt and also the amount of other 12 types exercise they would have done to burn the same amount of calories. The results will be shown in respective text view boxes one by one in this Linear Layout. The linear layout supports vertical scrolling for easy access of the complete information.
